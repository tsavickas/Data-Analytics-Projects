Hello,

There you can see one of the works done during the Tableau course at Vilnius Coding School. However, there I share
print screens only. The reason there are print screens only is GDPR. Because there were analyzing small family e-commerce
businesses, all data collected during the years are not allowed to share the public without each client's permission, 
which was not obtained.

Dynamic fields in the dashboard:
- Select Year
- Select Month
- TOP Items Group. Most popular groups of products.
- Expand / Collapse TOP Items Group list
- TOP N Customers. Those who purchased most.
- Botto N Customers. Those who purchased at least.
- Ability to compare two periods of a different years.
